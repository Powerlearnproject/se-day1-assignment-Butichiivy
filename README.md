Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

It is the application of engineering principles to the development, maintenance and testing of software. Its important in the tech industru as it enables the creation of software solutions for businesses and consumers

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

a) Birth of Software Engineering where people coded in machine language

b) Rise of structured programming where programming languages like C was introduced to improve reliability

c) Agile methods and AI usage whereby sofware development is faster and more efficient

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

a) Planning- the project, objectives and requirements are defined clearly

b) Analysis- the system requirements and user needs are put together

c) Design- technical specifications and software architecture is developed

d) Implementation- a developer writes the code

e) Testing- the sample code is run to identify and fix bugs

f) Deployment and maintenance- the well functioning software is released to users while updates and fixes are done regularly

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodology is linear and sequential whereas agile methodology is iterative and flexible.

Waterfall methodology is hard to accomodate chanes whereas agile is adaptable to changes.

Waterfall methodology can be used for projects like banking software where the requirements are fixed and agile methodology is used for apps that require feedback based on user feedback.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

A software developer collaborates with designers and testers to build applications by writing, testing and maintaining the code.

A quality assurance engineer tests processes for efficiency by testing for bugs and ensuring requirements are met.

A program manager oversees timelines and team coordination.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs like Visual Studio Code provide tools for coding, debugging and testing. VCSs like Git help to track the code changes and enable collaboration.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

a)Tight deadlines- this can be overcome by usingproject management tools like Trelo.

b) Buggy Code- overcome by using debugging tools and peer code reviews to fix them.

c) Changing requirements- overcome by using agile methodology for flexibility.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
a) Unit testing tests individual components of the software.

b) Integration testing ensures different modules fit in and work together.

c) System testing tests the complete system for errors.

d) Acceotance testing ensurestheuser needs are met before release.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process of creating effective and precise instructions to get the most accurate results from AI.

It is important as AI responses are based on how well te prompt is structured.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague- "Tell me about PLP"

IMproved- "Explain what PLP is, the modules covered and how its better than other software engineering courses."
